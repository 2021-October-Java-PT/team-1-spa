            <p class>I'm a coding hippie. Two things fascinate me: people and coding. I am constantly curious about our interconnectivity and a tireless advocate for inclusiveness and diversity. 
            During the pandemic, I enrolled in a Software Development Bootcamp and learned that I am obsessed with learning all things code and that test driven development is my jam.
            My enthusiasm for people and coding transpires well in Agile environments. I am always willing to help a fellow developer with questions and advice and I love sparking joy in teams.
            As a previous educator for adult learners, I am an avid believer that we are all life long learners. I transition quickly into any team because I am ready to work, but also ready to learn from my team and mentors.
